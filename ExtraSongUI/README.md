# Extra Song UI
Wanna know if you're still on track for an FC? How far behind are you in getting that 7-star? This tweak is for you!
With this tweak, you can now see your song progress numerical, how many points you need to reach certain star amounts, and how many notes you've currently missed in the song! Hate how things are arranged? Press `Ctrl + Shift + F5` and customise everything!

## How to install
- You will need Clone Hero **v0.23.2.2**.
- Make sure you install CHLauncher first!
  - Navigate to the `#ch-launcher` channel, and download the latest version of CHLauncher.exe.
  - Run it, and patch your version of Clone Hero with it. You should now have a `Tweaks` folder in your Clone Hero folder.
- Download the latest version of `ExtraSongUI.dll` and place it in your tweaks folder.

## How to use
### Default usage
With the tweak loaded for the first time, you'll have a `ExtraSongUIConfig.xml` appear in your `Tweaks` folder. This file defines the layout used for all the elements in this tweak. If you begin playing any song (not in practice mode), you should notice a bunch of new user interface labels on the left side of the highway. These will live update with details about the song as you play.

### Configuring
You can press `Ctrl + Shift + F5` to open the configuration menu at any time in Clone Hero. This lets you access the details of every element used by the tweak, from the position, colour, size, alignment, and formatting. Simply navigate the menus and change the details of settings as you please. The elements on-screen will change in real time to help you create the layout you desire.

**The config is saved only when you ~~close the config window~~**, so if you decide to close your game before closing the window, your settings will not be saved. If you wish to reset the config, just simply delete `ExtraSongUIConfig.xml` (or rename or changing anything such that the file doesn't exist with its original name), and run Clone Hero again. Several defaults of the tweak are based on your screen resolution at the time, so if elements are a bit oddly positioned, try resetting your config.
