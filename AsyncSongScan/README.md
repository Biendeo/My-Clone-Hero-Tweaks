# Async Song Scan

## **HUGE DISCLAIMER: THIS TWEAK IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS NOT AT ALL TESTED OR COMPLETE! USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

### **DISCLAIMER: SCANNING UTILISES YOUR DISK A LOT, SO SLOWER DRIVES WILL STRUGGLE TO PLAY SONGS NORMALLY WHILE SCANNING!**

Hate having to go back to the menu to scan in new songs? This tweak has got you covered! Press the magic button, and continue playing Clone Hero as usual! When the scan is complete, the next time you enter the song select screen, all the songs you scanned will be there!

## How to install
- You will need Clone Hero **v0.23.2.2**.
- Make sure you install CHLauncher first!
  - Navigate to the `#ch-launcher` channel, and download the latest version of CHLauncher.exe.
  - Run it, and patch your version of Clone Hero with it. You should now have a `Tweaks` folder in your Clone Hero folder.
- ~~Download the latest version of `AsyncSongScan.dll` from [the releases page](https://github.com/Biendeo/My-Clone-Hero-Tweaks/releases) and place it in your tweaks folder.~~
  - **You'll have to build this tweak yourself.** Download Visual Studio 2019 with the .NET Framework 4.8.1 SDK and compile.

## How to use
### Default usage
Hitting `Ctrl + Shift + F8` at any time brings up a dialog window with one button on it. Click it and it should scan your songs folder just like it would from the menu! The song select screen won't update immediately if you're currently in it though, so you'll need to back out to the main menu first if you want to see the results.
