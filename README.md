## How to install
- You will need Clone Hero **v0.23.2.2**.
- Make sure you install CHLauncher first!
  - Navigate to the `#ch-launcher` channel, and download the latest version of CHLauncher.exe.
  - Run it, and patch your version of Clone Hero with it. You should now have a `Tweaks` folder in your Clone Hero folder.
- Download the tweaks you want from the `Releases` section and place them in that `Tweaks` folder.
