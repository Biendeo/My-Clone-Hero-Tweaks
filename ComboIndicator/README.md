# Combo Indicator
Get that Guitar Hero 3 nostalgia by having an animated note streak indicator pop up at 50, 100, 200, and so on combo!

## How to install
- You will need Clone Hero **v0.23.2.2**.
- Make sure you install CHLauncher first!
  - Navigate to the `#ch-launcher` channel, and download the latest version of CHLauncher.exe.
  - Run it, and patch your version of Clone Hero with it. You should now have a `Tweaks` folder in your Clone Hero folder.
- Download the latest version of `ComboIndicator.dll` from [the releases page](https://github.com/Biendeo/My-Clone-Hero-Tweaks/releases) and place it in your tweaks folder.

## How to use
### Default usage
Simply play the game as you usually would. When you hit 50, 100, 200, etc. notes, the indicator will show up for about three seconds. There's nothing more to this mod really at the moment.

Currently the only way to disable the tweak is to rename or delete the tweak, I'll try and add more functionality soon! In the meantime, leave me some feedback on anything that could be improved on!
